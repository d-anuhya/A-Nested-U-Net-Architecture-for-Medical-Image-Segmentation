# A-Nested-U-Net-Architecture-for-Medical-Image-Segmentation
Image Segmentation and UNet++ Model Implementation for Predicting Tumor in the Brain.
UNet is essentially a deeply supervised encoder-decoder network in which nested, dense hop-pathways connect the encoder-encoder networks.
The final model is a combination of a ResNeXt-based encoder and a U-Net-like decoder.
